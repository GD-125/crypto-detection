Develop a prototype of the ERP-integrated cryptographic function detection system by implementing modular Python microservices using PyTorch for explainable AI and Ghidra for multi-architecture binary disassembly. Create RESTful APIs with FastAPI to facilitate smooth interaction between the AI modules and a lightweight ERP dashboard for firmware upload, analysis triggering, and results visualization. Ensure feature extraction standardizes input from diverse ISAs, and incorporate XAI tools like Captum for transparent decision reporting. Containerize services with Docker to enable efficient local testing with predefined annotated firmware datasets, focusing on seamless integration, scalability, and optimized inference times for real-world deployment readiness.
